/**
 * Server-side product analytics (PostHog), OPTIONAL and env-gated.
 *
 * With no POSTHOG_KEY this is a complete no-op — every call returns instantly,
 * nothing is imported, nothing is sent. Set POSTHOG_KEY (and optionally
 * POSTHOG_HOST, default https://us.i.posthog.com) to start capturing.
 *
 * We capture *business* events server-side (booking created, invoice paid,
 * dispatch assigned) rather than relying on the browser, because:
 *   - money/dispatch events must be counted even if the client never pings back
 *   - server events can't be blocked by ad-blockers
 *   - we control the property allow-list, so no PII leaks by accident
 *
 * Property hygiene: we only ever send the explicit fields a caller passes. Pass
 * ids and amounts, NOT names/emails/addresses. `distinctId` should be a stable
 * opaque id (companyId is a good multi-tenant default).
