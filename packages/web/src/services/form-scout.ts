/**
 * Form Scout — generates 2-3 industry-appropriate starter intake forms for a
 * brand-new tenant during provisioning ("Grab Brand Assets" onboarding).
 *
 * Given what we learned about the company (name, services, description,
 * website, worker-noun), it asks the text model to design starter forms that
 * match how THAT industry actually intakes work — picking sensible fields,
 * titles, intros and success messages.
 *
 * Field keys are constrained to the platform's INTAKE_FIELD_CATALOG so every
 * generated field maps to a real, renderable input. Everything degrades
 * gracefully: if the model is unavailable or returns junk, we fall back to a
 * single generic "Request Service" form so provisioning never blocks.

Design 2 or 3 DISTINCT starter intake forms that reflect how this specific industry actually takes in work and follows best practices for lead capture. Examples of good differentiation:
- A roofing/exterior company: "Request a Free Inspection", "Get a Roof Replacement Quote", "Emergency Leak / Storm Damage".
- A building-materials supplier: "Request a Materials Quote", "Schedule a Delivery", "Contractor / Bulk Order Inquiry".
- An HVAC company: "Book a Tune-Up", "Request Emergency Repair", "New System Estimate".

For each form:
- Pick a clear, conversion-friendly title and a short friendly intro.
- Choose ONLY fields from this catalog (use the exact keys): ${FIELD_KEYS.join(", ")}.
- name, email, phone, address are ALWAYS included and required. Add serviceType, preferredAt, notes, photo only when they fit that form's purpose (e.g. include photo for damage/inspection forms; include preferredAt for scheduling/delivery forms).
- Write a warm, on-brand success message.

Tailor everything to ${input.name}'s actual line of work. Avoid generic duplicates — each form should serve a different customer intent.`,
