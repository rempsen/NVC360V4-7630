# NVC360 Admin Build-Out

Company default: **NVC 360**, 423 Main Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (was Toronto).

## Decisions
- Address autocomplete: **Google Places** (GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY) + map populate
- File uploads: **local server storage** (`/uploads`, served static)
- Custom fields builder on: Clients, Technicians, Work orders — field types incl. notes, file upload, checkbox, value, **signature**, **payment**
- Features: Company Settings, Tag management, Reviews moderation, Customer notes/timeline, Tech availability/shifts/time-off, Service zones (map polygons), Payouts/earnings, Audit log

## Live Traffic ETA (Google Distance Matrix)
- `GET /api/geo/eta?oLat&oLng&dLat&dLng` — server-side proxy to Google Distance Matrix (`mode=driving`, `departure_time=now` for traffic). Returns `{etaMins, distanceKm, durationText, provider}`. Falls back to haversine + AVG_KMH (32) estimate when no `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. Shared `computeEta()` exported from `routes/geo.ts`.
- `POST /api/tracking/:bookingId/ping` now recomputes traffic-aware ETA (tech ping coords → booking destination) and writes `bookings.etaMins`. Throttled to once per 30s per booking (`ETA_THROTTLE_MS`) to limit API calls.
- **Bug fixed:** ping handler previously overwrote `bookings.lat/lng` (the JOB destination) with the tech's live coords, corrupting the destination. Live location now lives only on `riders.lat/lng` + `trackingPings`; booking lat/lng stays the destination.
- Public track page (`/t/:token`) already polls `/api/track/:token` every 5s and renders `~{etaMins} min away`; now reflects real traffic ETA. Enroute SMS `{{eta}}` var also picks up the updated value.
- Verified: `provider:"google"` 38min/28.4km direct call; ping→etaMins=36 written + destination preserved.

## Customer ↔ Driver texting + Technician photos (added)
- **Two-way SMS messaging**: Public tracking page message thread now forwards real SMS.
  - Customer message → texts the assigned tech's phone (Twilio) with a link back to the thread (`routes/track.ts` POST /:token/messages).
  - Tech/dispatch reply (`routes/messages.ts`) → in-app notification + texts the customer (`bookings.customerPhone`) with the live thread link.
  - All sends use `services/sms.ts` `sendSms` + `trackingUrl`; no-ops gracefully when Twilio unset.
- **Technician headshots**: new `riders.photoUrl` column.
  - Upload/remove endpoints: `POST /api/riders/:id/photo` (multipart `file`, max 8MB, jpeg/png/webp) and `DELETE /api/riders/:id/photo`. Stored under `/uploads/`.
  - Admin UI: hover-to-upload camera overlay on the tech drawer avatar (`PhotoUploader` in `admin/riders.tsx`), with remove (x) button.
  - Reusable `<TechAvatar>` component (photo with initials fallback) used on: public track page, riders list + drawer, fleet panels, fleet map marker (CSS bg image), bookings assign list, scheduler columns.
  - `photoUrl` surfaced via `/api/track/:token`, `/api/fleet`, `/api/riders`.
